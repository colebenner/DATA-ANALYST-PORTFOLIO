This project will aim to identify patterns in criminal behavior in Los Angeles. Specifically, I will identify the hour with the highest 
frequency of crimes, stored as 'peak_crime_hour'. I'll also isolate the area with the largest frequency of night crimes (defined as 
between 10pm and 4am). Lastly, I'll use age group labels to to first classify different age ranges, and then find the age group who 
falls victim to the most crimes.

# Area with highest frequency of night crimes (10pm-3:59 am)

crimes['NIGHT_HOURS'] = crimes['HOUR_OCC'].isin(['^22|^23|^00|^01|^02|^03'])
AREA_OF_NC = crimes.groupby('AREA NAME')['NIGHT_HOURS'].value_counts()
peak_night_crime_location = AREA_OF_NC.idxmax()[0]

age_bins = [0, 17, 25, 34, 44, 54, 64, np.inf]
age_labels = ['0-17', '18-25', '26-34', '35-44', '45-54', '55-64', '65+']
crimes['age_values'] = pd.cut(crimes['Vict Age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels)
