This project will aim to identify patterns in criminal behavior in Los Angeles. Specifically, I will identify the hour with the highest 
frequency of crimes, stored as 'peak_crime_hour'. I'll also isolate the area with the largest frequency of night crimes (defined as 
between 10pm and 4am). Lastly, I'll use age group labels to to first classify different age ranges, and then find the age group who 
falls victim to the most crimes. Below you can find the columns available from the dataset with their respective descriptions.


## The Data

This is a modified version of the original data, which is publicly available from Los Angeles Open Data.

# crimes.csv

Conclusions:
The first table of results is generated by crimes.head(), which previews the data being worked with. The next result of '12' represents 
the peak_crime_hour. So, the most amount of crimes in Los Angeles in this dataset occurs at noon. The following result of 'Central' 
represents the peak_night_crime_location which tells us that the area of Central LA is experiencing the most crime after 10pm. The last 
table of results shows age ranges of victims and how many victims there are per age range. Without more information, it is difficult to 
draw conclusions. However, a few things that stick out to me include the relatively normal curve generated by this data. In theory, this 
bell curve could represent the psychology of the criminals and who they're willing to commit crimes against. It also makes sense that 
people between 25 and 45 would be in the most dense areas of LA, effectively exposing themselves to the most criminals at one time. Minor 
and senior citizens could also be spared either due to the psychology factor or because they're always accompanied by family members. 
Lots of potential conclusions can be made, but without any further numerical analysis, we can only speculate.
