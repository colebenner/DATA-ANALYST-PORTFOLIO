This project will take a look at Netflix movies, analyzing movies from the 1990s. This code identifies the most frequent movie duration, 
saved as an integer 'duration'. I will also be classifying a short movie as any film under 90 minutes long and using this classification 
to find the number of short action movies released in the 90s, saved as an integer 'short_movie_count'. Below, you can find available 
columns and their respective descriptions.



## The data
### **netflix_data.csv**
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `show_id` | The ID of the show |
| `type` | Type of show |
| `title` | Title of the show |
| `director` | Director of the show |
| `cast` | Cast of the show |
| `country` | Country of origin |
| `date_added` | Date added to Netflix |
| `release_year` | Year of Netflix release |
| `duration` | Duration of the show in minutes |
| `description` | Description of the show |
| `genre` | Show genre |



# Importing pandas and matplotlib
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read in CSV
netflix_df = pd.read_csv('netflix_data.csv')

# Filter out TV shows
netflix_subset = netflix_df[netflix_df['type'] != 'TV Show']

# Subset for netflix movies
netflix_movies = netflix_subset[["title", "country", "genre", "release_year", "duration"]]

# Subset for short movies
short_movies = netflix_movies.query("duration < 60")

# Assign different colors to different movie genres
colors = []
for label, row in netflix_movies.iterrows():
    if row["genre"] == "Children":
        colors.append('blue')
    elif row["genre"] == "Documentaries":
        colors.append('red')
    elif row["genre"] == "Stand-Up":
        colors.append('green')
    else:
        colors.append('yellow')
colors[:10]

# Plot a scatterplot utilizing the genre colors to visualize movie duration by year of release
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
plt.scatter(netflix_movies.release_year, netflix_movies.duration, c = colors)
plt.title("Movie Duration by Year of Release")
plt.xlabel("Release year")
plt.ylabel("Duration (min)")
plt.show()

Results:
The scatterplot produced by the above code can be found in the main branch of DATA-ANALYST-PORTFOLIO designated as Netflix Movie Duration 
by Year.png

Conclusions:
The Movie Duration by Year of Release scatterplot that has been generated features multiple trends we can visually analyze. First, the 
green points (Stand-Up) appear to have converged around 70 minutes of duration time. We can infer that over time, producers of stand-up 
comedy have seen data suggesting that the audience may lose interest after this time frame, and/or the most effective means of keeping 
an engaged audience lies around this duration. Moving on to the red plot points representing documentaries, there has been an obvious 
increase in volume over time. The duration still presents as fairly random, but it follows common sense that as Netflix becomes more 
readily available through streaming services, the demand for information grows. There are infinite topics documentaries can be centered 
around. It follows that as time continues, the volume of documentaries may also continue to grow as producers venture into untapped 
fields. The last named genre, children, represented by the color blue, visualizes itself on the graph as randomly as children act. With a 
cluster of red below an hour, we can assume that some producers keep children's movies as possible to maintain their attention. However, 
there are also lots of red scatter points above 100 minutes. The field does not seem to be in one headspace around children's movies. Thus, 
we would need additional analysis to draw any further conclusions.
