This project will take a look at Netflix movies, analyzing movies from the 1990s. This code identifies the most frequent movie duration, 
saved as an integer 'duration'. I will also be classifying a short movie as any film under 90 minutes long and using this classification 
to find the number of short action movies released in the 90s, saved as an integer 'short_movie_count'.

# Read in CSV
netflix_df = pd.read_csv('netflix_data.csv')
# Filter out TV shows
netflix_subset = netflix_df[netflix_df['type'] != 'TV Show']
# Subset for netflix movies
netflix_movies = netflix_subset[["title", "country", "genre", "release_year", "duration"]]
# Subset for short movies
short_movies = netflix_movies.query("duration < 60")
# Assign different colors to different movie genres
colors = []
for label, row in netflix_movies.iterrows():
    if row["genre"] == "Children":
        colors.append('blue')
    elif row["genre"] == "Documentaries":

    elif row["genre"] == "Stand-Up":
        colors.append('green')

plt.title("Movie Duration by Year of Release")
plt.xlabel("Release year")
