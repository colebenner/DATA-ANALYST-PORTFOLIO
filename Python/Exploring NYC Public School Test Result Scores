This project looks at test results from NYC public schools. In particular, I will isolate the schools with the best math scores, 
saving my results as a pandas Dataframe, 'best_math_schools'. I'll also identify the top 10 performing schools based on combined SAT 
scores. Lastly, I'll be examining which single borough in NYC has the largest standard deviation.


# Import pandas 
import pandas as pd

# Read in the data
schools = pd.read_csv("schools.csv")

# Preview the data
schools.head()

# Create new DF: 'best_math_schools'
best_math_schools = schools[schools["average_math"] >= 640][["school_name", "average_math"]].sort_values("average_math", ascending=False)
print(best_math_schools)

# Create new column for total average SAT score
schools['total_SAT'] = schools["average_math"] + schools["average_reading"] + schools["average_writing"]

# Identify top 10 schools, sorted by total SAT
top_10_schools = schools.sort_values('total_SAT', ascending=False)[["school_name", "total_SAT"]].head(10)

# Group by borough
boroughs = schools.groupby('borough')["total_SAT"].agg(["count", "mean", "std"]).round(2)

# Filter for largest standard deviation
largest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs["std"] == boroughs["std"].max()]

# Rename columns
largest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={"count": "num_schools", "mean": "average_SAT", "std": "std_SAT"})
print(largest_std_dev)
