This short project utilizes a PostgreSQL database containing product emissions from various companies across several industries. I will 
query the database to find the number of unique companies and their total carbon footprint for each industry group. I'll also filter for 
the most recent year in the database, returning industry_group, num_companies, and total_industry_footprint.


SELECT DISTINCT industry_group, COUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies, ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint
FROM product_emissions
WHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions)
GROUP BY industry_group
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;
