This short project utilizes a dataset containing product emissions from various companies across several industries. I will query the 


SELECT DISTINCT industry_group, COUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies, ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint
FROM product_emissions
WHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions)
GROUP BY industry_group
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;
