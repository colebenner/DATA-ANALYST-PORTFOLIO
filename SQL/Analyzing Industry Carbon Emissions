This short project utilizes a PostgreSQL database containing product emissions from various companies across several industries. I will 
query the database to find the number of unique companies and their total carbon footprint for each industry group. I'll also filter for 
the most recent year in the database, returning industry_group, num_companies, and total_industry_footprint.


SELECT DISTINCT industry_group, COUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies, ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint
FROM product_emissions
WHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions)
GROUP BY industry_group
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;

Results:
industry_group	                num_companies	      total_industry_footprint
Materials	                                3	                        107129
Capital Goods	                                2	                        94942.7
Technology Hardware & Equipment	                4	                        21865.1
"Food, Beverage & Tobacco"	                1	                        3161.5
Commercial & Professional Services	        1	                        740.6
Software & Services	                        1	                        690


Conclusions:
At first glance we can see that materials is the industry group with the largest total industry footprint. However, with 3 companies 
involved in materials and only 2 producing capital goods, the highest average industry footprint belongs to the capital goods industry 
yielding 47,471.35 CO2 per company. Meanwhile, the average industry footprint per material company is 35,709.67 CO2. In the same sense, 
the technology hardware & equipment industry is significantly less menacing to the environment per company as it only averages 5,466.275 
CO2 industry footprint. Ultimately, after analyzing this query's results, it is evident that the capital goods industry stresses the 
environment more than any other industry and if actions were to be taken... restrictions should be placed on the industry as a whole to 
aid in the planet's longevity.
