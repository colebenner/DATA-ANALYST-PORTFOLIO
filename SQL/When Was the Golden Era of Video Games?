This project analyzes video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 games released since 1977. The queries 
below will demonstrate my knowledge of joining datasets, filtering, grouping, and ordering data. I'll be finding (1) the 10 best selling 
games, stored as 'best_selling_games'. Next, I'll identify (2) the 10 years with the highest average critic score where at least 4 games were 
released. Lastly, I'll point out (3) the years wheres both users and critics agreed on highly rated games, returning the years where average 
critic score or average user score was over 9. Below, you'll find all columns available in all databases and their respective datatypes.
