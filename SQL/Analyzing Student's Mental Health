This project evaluates data on students from a Japanese international university in 2018. This data was used to publish a study that identified a higher risk of mental health issues in international students. I will query the same data with the intention of identifying the same trends. I will first, (1) view all data to grasp the extent of what I'm working with. Then second, (2) query the data to find the amount of international students 


(1)
SELECT * 
FROM students;

(2)
SELECT stay,
       COUNT(*) as count_int,
       ROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq,
       ROUND(AVG(tosc), 2) AS average_scs,
       ROUND(AVG(toas), 2) AS average_as
FROM students
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter'
GROUP BY stay
ORDER BY stay DESC;
