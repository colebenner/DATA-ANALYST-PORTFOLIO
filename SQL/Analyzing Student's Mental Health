This project evaluates data on students from a Japanese international university in 2018. This data was used to publish a study that 
identified a higher risk of mental health issues in international students. I will utilize PostgreSQL to query the same data with the 
intention of identifying the same trends. I will first, (1) view all data to grasp the extent of what I'm working with. Then second, (2) 
query the data to find the amount of international students & their length of stay in years, the average PHQ-9 test score (depression), the average SCS test score (social connectedness), and the average 
ASISS test score (acculturative stress).


(1)
SELECT * 
FROM students;

(2)
SELECT stay,
       COUNT(*) as count_int,
       ROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq,
       ROUND(AVG(tosc), 2) AS average_scs,
       ROUND(AVG(toas), 2) AS average_as
FROM students
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter'
GROUP BY stay
ORDER BY stay DESC;

Conclusions:
While looking at length of stay when compared to average_phq, average_scs, and average_as multiple takeaways jump out at me. The study 
mentioned indicates that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that 
social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are 
predictive of depression. However, what I see when analyzing these trends is slightly different with perspective. None of the 3 variables
mentioned show a continuous linear trend. Average_phq is highest at a stay length of 10 years, but there also exists a window in years 5-7 
where international students appear depression free, or close to it. Average_scs score starts relatively high, progressively drops over 
the years, and then proceeds to climb once again. I'd interpret this to mean that international students place priority on fitting in when 
they arrive in a foreign country and as time passes, become focused on their own personal endeavors and the reasons that traveled in the 
first place. Eventually, they find their groove and begin to grow their social connectedness again. This trend seems not only natural in 
my eyes, but healthly. Finally, average_as also starts relatively high and continues to climb until year 5 when international students 
appear to drastically become more accustomed to the culture around them. Once again, a natural introduction to a new environment. 
Ultimately, a wave of initial depression when moving by yourself to a new country does not stray far from the realm of reality. And an 
rapid increase in depression 8-10 years into an international stay could be due to a variety of possibilities. The trends I see through 
this data is consistent with natural tendencies, and I do not believe to be worrisome when considering the big picture.
