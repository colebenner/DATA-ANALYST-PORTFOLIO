This project evaluates data on students from a Japanese international university in 2018. This data was used to publish a study that 
identified a higher risk of mental health issues in international students. I will utilize PostgreSQL to query the same data with the 
intention of identifying the same trends. I will first, (1) view all data to grasp the extent of what I'm working with. Then second, (2) 
query the data to find the amount of international students, the average PHQ-9 test score, the average SCS test score, and the average 
ASISS test score.


(1)
SELECT * 
FROM students;

(2)
SELECT stay,
       COUNT(*) as count_int,
       ROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq,
       ROUND(AVG(tosc), 2) AS average_scs,
       ROUND(AVG(toas), 2) AS average_as
FROM students
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter'
GROUP BY stay
ORDER BY stay DESC;
