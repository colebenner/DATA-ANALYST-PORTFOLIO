This project looks at a PostgreSQL database containing data on electric vehicle charging sessions. I'll query this database to find 
answers to a variety of questions. First, I'll find (1) the number of unique individuals that use garage's shared charging stations, 
stored as 'unique_users_per_garage'. I'll also evaluate (2) the top 10 most popular charging start times, stored as 
'most_popular_shared_start_times'. Lastly, I'll find (3) the users whose average charging duration lasts longer than 10 hours when using 
shared charging stations, stored as 'long_duration_shared_users'. Below, you can find the columns available in the database, along with 
their definitions and datatypes.


## charging_sessions

| Column | Definition | Data type |
|-|-|-|
|`garage_id`| Identifier for the garage/building|`VARCHAR`|
|`user_id` | Identifier for the individual user|`VARCHAR`|
|`user_type`|Indicating whether the station is `Shared` or `Private`| `VARCHAR` |
|`start_plugin`|The date and time the session started |`DATETIME`|
|`start_plugin_hour`|The hour (in military time) that the session started | `NUMERIC`|
|`end_plugout`|The date and time the session ended | `DATETIME` |
|`eng_plugin_hour`|The hour (in military time) that the session ended | `NUMERIC`|
|`duration_hours`| The length of the session, in hours|`NUMERIC`|
|`el_kwh`| Amount of electricity used (in Kilowatt hours)|`NUMERIC`|
|`month_plugin`| The month that the session started |`VARCHAR`|
|`weekdays_plugin`| The day of the week that the session started|`VARCHAR`|

(1)
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT user_id) AS num_unique_users, garage_id
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY garage_id
ORDER BY num_unique_users DESC;

(2)
SELECT weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour, COUNT(start_plugin_hour) AS num_charging_sessions
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour
ORDER BY num_charging_sessions DESC
LIMIT 10;

(3)
SELECT user_id, AVG(duration_hours) AS avg_charging_duration
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING AVG(duration_hours) > 10
ORDER BY avg_charging_duration DESC;
