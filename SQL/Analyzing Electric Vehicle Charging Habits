This project looks at a PostgreSQL database containing data on electric vehicle charging sessions. I'll query this database to find 
answers to a variety of questions. First, I'll find (1) the number of unique individuals that use garage's shared charging stations, 
stored as 'unique_users_per_garage'. I'll also evaluate (2) the top 10 most popular charging start times, stored as 
'most_popular_shared_start_times'. Lastly, I'll find (3) the users whose average charging duration lasts longer than 10 hours when using 
shared charging stations, stored as 'long_duration_shared_users'. Below, you can find the columns available in the database, along with 
their definitions and datatypes.


## charging_sessions

| Column | Definition | Data type |
|-|-|-|
|`garage_id`| Identifier for the garage/building|`VARCHAR`|
|`user_id` | Identifier for the individual user|`VARCHAR`|
|`user_type`|Indicating whether the station is `Shared` or `Private`| `VARCHAR` |
|`start_plugin`|The date and time the session started |`DATETIME`|
|`start_plugin_hour`|The hour (in military time) that the session started | `NUMERIC`|
|`end_plugout`|The date and time the session ended | `DATETIME` |
|`eng_plugin_hour`|The hour (in military time) that the session ended | `NUMERIC`|
|`duration_hours`| The length of the session, in hours|`NUMERIC`|
|`el_kwh`| Amount of electricity used (in Kilowatt hours)|`NUMERIC`|
|`month_plugin`| The month that the session started |`VARCHAR`|
|`weekdays_plugin`| The day of the week that the session started|`VARCHAR`|

(1)
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT user_id) AS num_unique_users, garage_id
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY garage_id
ORDER BY num_unique_users DESC;

(2)
SELECT weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour, COUNT(start_plugin_hour) AS num_charging_sessions
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour
ORDER BY num_charging_sessions DESC
LIMIT 10;

(3)
SELECT user_id, AVG(duration_hours) AS avg_charging_duration
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING AVG(duration_hours) > 10
ORDER BY avg_charging_duration DESC;

Conclusions:
Query (1) highlights the number of unique individuals per garage charging station. These numbers do not require any further analysis.

Query (2), however, singles out the top 10 most popular start times when charging cars. As expected, people tend to find charging stations 
after 3 pm. We can make an educated guess that people are rushing to charging stations after work and preparing for the following day. The 
earliest start times can also be found on Friday, Sunday, and Monday which can be explained by weekend plans.

Query (3) ranks the top shared charging stations for users averaging over 10 hour sessions. This is another query that does not require 
too much analysis, as we would need a map with locations of these stations to make our own assumptions.
