This project utilizes data collected by The World Bank and aims to evaluate the debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several 
categories. The following queries will answer the following questions: 1. what is the number of distinct countries present in the 
database, 2. what country has the highest amount of debt, and 3. what country has the lowest amount of repayments. Below you will also 
find the column names available and their respective data types.

## `international_debt` table

| Column | Definition | Data Type |
|-|-|-|
|country_name|Name of the country|`varchar`|
|country_code|Code representing the country|`varchar`|
|indicator_name|Description of the debt indicator|`varchar`|
|indicator_code|Code representing the debt indicator|`varchar`|
|debt|Value of the debt indicator for the given country (in current US dollars)|`float`|

1.
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT country_name) AS total_distinct_countries
FROM international_debt;

2.
SELECT country_name, SUM(debt) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY total_debt DESC
LIMIT 1;

3.
SELECT country_name, indicator_name, MIN(debt) AS lowest_repayment
FROM international_debt
WHERE 'DT.AMT.DLXF.CD' = indicator_code
GROUP BY country_name, indicator_name
ORDER BY lowest_repayment ASC
LIMIT 1;
